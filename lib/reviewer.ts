// Stopgap identity capture, ahead of real user/admin auth (planned next).
//
// Every write that records "who did this" (saveReview's reviewed_by, and the
// new pending_changes proposed_by/applied_by on ds-smith-manifest-review)
// was previously always sent as "" — there was no session identity anywhere
// in either app. Rather than block on auth landing, this asks once per
// browser and remembers the answer, so the audit trail starts filling in now
// instead of staying permanently blank.
//
// Deliberately stores an email, not a display name — a future auth migration
// can backfill a user_id by matching on email, which a free-text name can't
// support reliably.
//
// Kept identical to ds-smith-manifest-review/lib/reviewer.ts — these are two
// separate Next.js apps with no shared package between them, so this is a
// deliberate duplication rather than an import.
